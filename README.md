# odin-javascript
All of the javascript exercises that i've done from TOP. I know that it is generally better practice to link javascript in an external file, however this repo would become much more cluttered then it already is, so for the little readability I can save, all of the javascript is in the html file.

For the odin exercises that were in they repo they gave me, I will add those to this repo once I've finished all of them.
